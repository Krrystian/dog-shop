This is a [NextJS 13](https://nextjs.org/) full-stack project made for learning purposes.

## Description

Dog shop! Shop for dogs! Shop for people with dogs! Whatever you want to call it - my attempt to use part of my university knowledge to make a website that works! It is a website that imitate online shop. For testing purposes I made admin and user accounts for your use, but feel free to make your own accounts to test it.

#### Why I made it

I made that project to challenge myself. After making some React frontend pages - next step is to become a single-army fullstack dev. I find it very satisfying. Solving problems and working with a database - different experience. There is a bunch of things I learned:

- HTTP status (well I thought I knew them before but working with them... 500... 400... 304...)
- API / REST API (how to call API, [AXIOS](https://axios-http.com/) client with a Next based APIs)
- Database callbacks (making MongoDB schema with [PRISMA](https://www.prisma.io/) also creating, finding objects, modifying them, handling errors)
- State management (so easy to get lost in states... great solution [🐻ZUSTAND🐻](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/))

#### Project - what you should not expect

First of all it was my first try of making full-stack web. Other than account safety you should **not expect any other safety**.. It would not be hard for someone who knows HTTP requests to get access to admin dashboard, but I made it easier :P. It is also **not a high advanced design** with lot of futures, animation website - it was never a priority but I hope simplicity is never a crime. **Not 100% error proof.** (like any other website) I tried my best but sometimes error appears, best solution -> try to refresh page or DM me.
